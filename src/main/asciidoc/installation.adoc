=== Downloading and Installing

You can download the CometD distribution from http://download.cometd.org/. 

Then unpack the distribution in a directory of your choice:

----
$ tar zxvf cometd-<version>-distribution.tgz
$ cd cometd-<version>/
----

[[_installation_demos]]
=== Running the Demos

The CometD Demos contain: 

* Two full chat applications (one developed with Dojo, one with jQuery). 
* Examples of extensions such as message acknowledgement, reload, timesync and timestamp. 
* An example of how to echo private messages to a particular client only. 
* Clustered Auction demo (using the <<_oort,Oort clustering>>).

To try out the CometD demos shipped with the distribution, you need a
Java Development Kit (JDK) â€“ version 7.0 or later, and either
http://maven.apache.org[Maven] (version 3 or later) or a compliant Servlet 3.0
or greater container such as http://eclipse.org/jetty[Jetty].

==== Running the Demos with Maven

Maven requires you to set up the +JAVA_HOME+ environment variable to point to
your JDK installation.

After that, running the CometD demos is very simple.
Assuming that +$COMETD+ is the CometD installation directory, and that you have
the +mvn+ executable in your path:

----
$ cd $COMETD
$ cd cometd-demo
$ mvn jetty:deploy-war
----

The last command starts an embedded Jetty that listens on port 8080.
Now point your browser to http://localhost:8080, to see the CometD Demos main page. 

==== Running the Demos with Jetty or Another Servlet Container

In the +$COMETD/cometd-demo/target+ directory you can find a deployable WAR file
that you can deploy in any Servlet Container (version 3.0 or greater).
Refer to the Servlet Container configuration manual to learn how to deploy the
WAR in your Servlet Container.
Refer also to <<_java_server_configuration_servlet_30,this section>> for further
information and for specific instructions related to deployment on Servlet 3.0
(or greater) Containers.
