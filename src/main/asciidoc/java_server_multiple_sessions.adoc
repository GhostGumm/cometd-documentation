==== Multiple Sessions

The http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt[HTTP protocol] recommends a connection
limit of two connections per domain.
While modern browsers are configured by default with more than two connections
per domain, it is not safe to make such an assumption; thus any iframes, tabs
or windows on the same browser connecting to the same host need to share two connections.

If two iframes/tabs/windows initiate a Bayeux communication, both start a
long poll connect request and both connections are consumed, making it impossible
to send another Bayeux request (for example, a publish) until one of the two
long polls returns.

The CometD Server implements the +multiple-clients+ advice (see also
<<_bayeux_multiple_clients_advice,this section>>). The server uses +BAYEUX_BROWSER+
cookie to detect multiple CometD clients from the same browser.

If the CometD server detects multiple clients, only one long poll connection
is allowed, and subsequent long poll requests do not wait for messages before returning.
They return immediately with the +multiple-clients+ field of the advice object set to true.
The advice also contains an +interval+ field set to the value of the +multiSessionInterval+
servlet init parameter (see also <<_java_server_configuration,the server configuration section>>).
This instructs the client not to send another poll until that interval has elapsed.
The effect of this advice is that additional client connections normally poll
the server with a period of +multiSessionInterval+.
This avoids consuming both HTTP connections at the cost of some latency for
the additional iframes/tabs/windows.

We recommend that the client application monitor the +/meta/connect+ channel
for +multiple-clients+ field in the advice.
If detected, the application might ask the user to close the additional tabs,
or it could automatically close them, or take some other action.

Non-browser clients (or browsers with cookies disabled) must handle the +BAYEUX_BROWSER+
cookie with the same semantic of browsers, or configure the server to allow
multiple sessions even without +BAYEUX_BROWSER+ information via the
+allowMultiSessionsNoBrowser+ servlet init parameter (see also
<<_java_server_configuration,the server configuration section>>).
