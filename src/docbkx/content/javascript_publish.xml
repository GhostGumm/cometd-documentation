<para>
    The <code>publish()</code> method allows you to publish data onto a certain channel:
</para>
<informalexample>
<programlisting language="javascript"><![CDATA[
cometd.publish('/mychannel', { mydata: { foo: 'bar' } });
]]></programlisting>
</informalexample>
<para>
    You cannot (and it makes no sense to) publish to a meta channel, but you can publish to a service or normal channel even if you are
    not subscribed to that channel.
    However, you have to handshake before you are able to publish.

    As with other JavaScript CometD API, <code>publish()</code> involves a communication with the server and it is
    asynchronous: it returns immediately, well before the Bayeux server has received the message.
</para>
<note>
<para>
    Calling <code>publish()</code> <emphasis role="bold"> does not </emphasis> mean that you have published the message when <code>publish()</code> returns.
</para>
</note>
<para>
    If you need to publish several messages to different channels, you might want to use
    <xref linkend="javascript_batch" />.
