        <title>JavaScript CometD 2 API: Publishing</title>
     </info>
     <para>
The <code>publish()</code> method allow you to publish data onto a certain channel:
<screen>
cometd.publish('/mychannel', { mydata: { foo: 'bar' } });
</screen>
You cannot (and it makes no sense) to publish to a meta channel, and you can publish to a channel even if you are not subscribed to that channel.
However, you have to handshake before being able to publish.
</para>
<para>
As with other JavaScript CometD API, <code>publish()</code> involves a communication with the server and it is asynchronous: it returns immediately, well before the Bayeux server has received the message.
</para>
<para>
<note>
Calling <code>publish()</code> does not mean that you have published the message when <code>publish()</code> returns.

</para>
<para>
If you need to publish several messages to different channels, you might want to use <xref linkend="batching" />.
